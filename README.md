# Step 7

# Unit Testing
Unit test is a piece of code that tests a unit of work, logical unit in the tested system. Your unit tests should be:
    – automated
    – independent
    – consistent and repeatable
    – maintainable

## User Testing
    - Start a user test file
    - Make sure to override application.py with `**config_overrides` and add the config_overrides
    - Build the main tests.py file
